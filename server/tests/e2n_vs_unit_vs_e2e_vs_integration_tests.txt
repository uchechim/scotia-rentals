Summary

--- Unit Tests: ---

* Focus on individual components or endpoints.
* Use mocking to isolate the unit under test.
* Ensure that the unit functions correctly on its own.

--- End-to-End (e2e) Tests ---

Purpose:

* Validate the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
* Ensure that all components and services work together as expected.
* Detect issues that might arise due to integration problems, UI issues, or unexpected behaviors.

Focus:

* Simulate real user interactions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating between pages, etc.
* Test the complete application workflow, from initial state to final state.
* Verify that the application responds correctly to user inputs and performs the expected actions.

--- Integration Tests ---

Definition:
* Integration tests are a type of software testing where individual units or components of an application are combined and tested as a group. 
* The primary goal of integration testing is to verify that different modules or services within the application interact correctly 
and work together as expected.

Purpose:
* Ensure that different parts of the system work together.
* Detect issues that may arise from the interaction between integrated components.
* Validate the communication between modules, such as function calls, data exchange, and interface compliance.

Focus:
* Interaction between integrated components, rather than the functionality of individual units.
* Correct data exchange and control flow between modules.
* The behavior of interfaces and dependencies between components.

Clarifying Definitions

Unit Tests:
Focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation.
Mock external dependencies, such as databases or external services, to ensure the unit of code is tested independently.

Integration Tests:
Focus on testing the interactions between integrated components within the application.
Ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected.
Typically involve real databases or services but are still within the same system.


Unit Test for Property Listings:
Testing the business logic for creating a property listing without actually interacting with the database.
Mocking the database session to ensure the function behaves correctly in isolation.

Example:
import json
from unittest.mock import patch
from app import create_app

@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def test_client():
    flask_app = create_app()
    flask_app.config.from_object('config.TestConfig')

    with flask_app.test_client() as testing_client:
        with flask_app.app_context():
            yield testing_client

def test_create_property_listing(test_client):
    # Define test property data
    test_property_data = {
        'title': 'Test Property',
        'description': 'A beautiful test property.',
        'price': 1000,
        'location': 'Test City'
    }

    # Mock the database session
    with patch('app.models.db.session') as mock_db_session:
        # Mock the commit method to avoid actual database interaction
        mock_db_session.commit.return_value = None

        # Mock an API call to create a property listing
        response = test_client.post('/properties', data=json.dumps(test_property_data), content_type='application/json')

        # Verify that the property listing was successfully created
        assert response.status_code == 201
        assert response.json['message'] == 'Property listing created successfully'

        # Verify the database interactions
        mock_db_session.add.assert_called_once()  # Ensure the add method was called
        mock_db_session.commit.assert_called_once()  # Ensure the commit method was called


Integration Test for Property Listings:
Testing the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of property listings using the actual database.
Verifies that the application components (API endpoint and database) work together correctly.

Example:

import json
import pytest
from app import create_app
from app.models import db, Property

@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def test_client():
    flask_app = create_app()
    flask_app.config.from_object('config.TestConfig')

    with flask_app.test_client() as testing_client:
        with flask_app.app_context():
            db.create_all()
            yield testing_client
            db.drop_all()

def test_create_property_listing(test_client):
    # Define test property data
    test_property_data = {
        'title': 'Test Property',
        'description': 'A beautiful test property.',
        'price': 1000,
        'location': 'Test City'
    }

    # Call the API endpoint to create a property listing
    response = test_client.post('/properties', data=json.dumps(test_property_data), content_type='application/json')

    # Verify that the property listing was successfully created
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json['message'] == 'Property listing created successfully'

    # Verify that the property exists in the database
    property = Property.query.filter_by(title='Test Property').first()
    assert property is not None
    assert property.description == 'A beautiful test property.'
    assert property.price == 1000
    assert property.location == 'Test City'

    # Clean up: Delete the test property
    db.session.delete(property)
    db.session.commit()

Summary
Unit Tests: Test individual functions or methods in isolation, often using mocks for external dependencies.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different components within the application, such as between the API and the database.
By clearly distinguishing between these types of tests and understanding their scope, you can create a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures your application is robust and reliable.
