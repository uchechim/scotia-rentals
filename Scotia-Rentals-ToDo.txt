This file holds all bugs that I notice while developing the application.

1 - Refactor backend to be modular (follow some form of design pattern for modern flask bakend applications)

2 - Update listings workflow to provide discreet renter-side & landlord-side listings. I.E -> Landlord should only be able to view their own listings

3 - Find a way to abstract/hide all secrets from application both front-end and back-end. I.E AWS Access keys, passwords e.t.c in code should not be visible in the public git repository.

4 - Fix rendering bug -> UI doesn't update properly whenever logging in. Must refresh to see the components correctly i.e Button styles e.t.c

5 - Fix bug with listings -> currently when listings are uploaded from the landlord side, the correct data isn't always displayed i.e (New Listing 2 vs New Listing from Landlord_1). Look into this
