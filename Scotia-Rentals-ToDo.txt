1 - Update listings workflow to provide discreet renter-side & landlord-side listings. I.E -> Landlord should only be able to view their own listings

2 - Find a way to abstract/hide all secrets from application both front-end and back-end. I.E AWS Access keys, passwords e.t.c in code should not be visible in the public git repository.
