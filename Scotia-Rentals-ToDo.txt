#### This file holds all bugs that I notice while developing the application.

1 - Refactor backend to be modular (follow some form of design pattern for modern flask backend applications) - TODO

2 - Update listings workflow to provide discreet renter-side & landlord-side listings. I.E -> Landlord should only be able to view their own listings - TODO

3 - Find a way to abstract/hide all secrets from application both front-end and back-end. I.E AWS Access keys, passwords e.t.c in code should not be visible in the public git repository. - TODO

4 - Fix rendering bug -> UI doesn't update properly whenever logging in. Must refresh to see the components correctly i.e Button styles e.t.c - TODO

5 - Fix bug with listings -> currently when listings are uploaded from the landlord side, the correct data isn't always displayed i.e (New Listing 2 vs New Listing from Landlord_1). Look into this. - TODO


#### Future Plans

1 - Revamp Frontend
2 - Rebrand Application (new name, new look, e.t.c)
3 - Integrate some ML/AI features to further modernize the application
